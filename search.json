Since there is a column named xyz, the expression df$x will be expanded to df$xyz. This behavior of the $ operator saves a few keystrokes, but it can result in accidentally using a different column than you thought you were using.\n\nWith [ the type of object that is returned differs on the number of columns. If it is one column, it won’t return a data.frame, but instead will return a vector. With more than one column, then it will return a data.frame. This is fine if you know what you are passing in, but suppose you did df[ , vars] where vars was a variable. Then what that code does depends on length(vars) and you’d have to write code to account for those situations or risk bugs.\n\nFor tibbles,\n\nWhen using the matrix subsetting method, a tibble always return a tibble.\n\n\nWhen using $ to grab an element, tibbles never do partial matching.\n\n\n[] always returns another tibble, regardless of list or matrix subsetting method.\n\n\n$ and [[]] return a vector.\n\n\nTibbles never do partial matching and name “x” cannot be recognized.\n\n\nWhat does tibble::enframe() do? Try enframe(c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)).

What should I do in R or Python to import correctly and verify it”\n“What are the most common silent errors from automatic type guessing during CSV import”\n“If a date column mixes formats like YYYY MM DD and MM slash DD slash YYYY, what should I check after import”\n“Give me a post import validation checklist for columns that look numeric but are stored as text, such as currency and percentages”\n\n\n\n\nStep 3 Create the AI Interaction Log\nFor each prompt, include:\n\nPrompt goal\nThe AI response excerpt you used\nYour annotation:\n\nWhat AI got right\nWhat AI assumed\nWhat was missing, misleading, or incorrect\n\n\nImportant rule\n\nYou may not paste AI text into your final synthesis verbatim.\n\n\n\nStep 4 Import the dataset and run required validation checks\nImport the required file, then complete the validation checklist below. Your evidence can be screenshots, printed outputs, or short summaries of what you observed.\n\nRequired post import validation checklist (submit evidence for every item)\n1. Rows and columns\n\nConfirm the dataset has 600 rows and 79 columns after import.\n\n2. Missing value tokens\n\nIdentify at least three different missing value representations present in the file (examples include NA, N slash A, blank, period).\nReport how many appear in at least two columns of your choice.\n\n3. Date columns\n\nIdentify at least two date columns (examples include last_scraped, host_since).\nShow evidence that more than one date format exists in the data.\nState whether your import tool parsed them as dates or left them as text.\n\n4. Percent columns stored as text\n\nCheck host_response_rate and host_acceptance_rate.\nShow the raw format you observe (for example values that include a percent sign).\nState what type your import tool assigned and what conversion would be required.\n\n5. Currency stored as text\n\nCheck the price column.\nShow the raw format you observe (for example dollar sign and commas).\nState what type your import tool assigned and what conversion would be required.\n\n6. Logical values coded as text\n\nCheck host_is_superhost.\nList the unique values you observe (for example t and f).\nState what type your import tool assigned and what conversion would be required.\n\n7. Text encoding and non ASCII characters\n\nFind at least one host_name that contains non ASCII characters (examples include accented letters).\nShow evidence that the character displays correctly after import.\nState what could go wrong if encoding is not handled properly.\n\n8. Silent type coercion risk\n\nIdentify one column where automatic guessing could lead to a silent mistake.\nExplain the mistake, why it could be hard to notice, and how you would detect it.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5 Write the Human Authored Synthesis (group)\nLength target: 400 to 600 words.\nYour synthesis must include:\n\nYour investigation question\nAt least two hidden assumptions with evidence from your validation checks\nA clear explanation of why the assumptions matter for later analysis\nA short recommended import and validation routine for this dataset type\n\nYour synthesis must be written in your own words.\n\n\nStep 6 Presentation slides (group)\nUse this exact slide structure:\n\nOur question\nWhat AI suggested\nWhere AI fell short\nOur corrected understanding, with evidence\nOne takeaway for future data science work\n\nTime: 5 to 7 minutes.",

And that’s probably why you don’t learn R in an intro programming course.\nSo you can view Python as a smart phone. It can do many different things, phone, camera, email, social media. But R is like a high quality camera. You cannot use it to write emails, text messages, but it produces high quality photos.\nRStudio is not a programming language, but a software application.\nCode itself is just a text file. You can use any text editor or software to write your code.\nSo RStudio makes programming in R more easily and efficiently. It provides so many useful functions for you that doing data science becomes a piece of cake.\nToday, You are gonna have a chance to play with different panes and functions in RStudio. OK."

And you go back and forth lots of times. At the end, it’s everything like final, final3, final10, final_last whatever, it just keeps going.\nThe thing is these file names are not really very informative because final or final revisions don’t really say anything.\nBut if you really had tagged the changes you make between the final and the final 2, that could actually be informative if you actually have to go back to them."

This data transformation further cleans the data, so that we can extract any information we need from data more easily and efficiently. In other words, we improve the quality of data."

We start with learning popular data science tools such as basic R and Python programming, Git and GitHub, and interactive publishing system Quarto. Then we learn data importing, data visualization and data wrangling using both R and Python. The second half of the course focuses on several basic simulation and machine learning methods, including Monte Carlo simulation, linear regression, K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, principal component analysis, and K-means clustering. We learn R tidyverse and tidymodels packages. For Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn libraries are introduced.\n\nLearning outcomes\nBy the end of the course, students will be able to:\n\nExecute a reproducible data science workflow using R and Python with Quarto and version control practices (Git and GitHub) to produce, share, and update analyses.\nImport, clean, reshape, and visualize data to create effective representations that support exploration and decision making.\nApply machine learning and statistical modeling methods including simulation and core supervised and unsupervised learning tools to detect patterns and evaluate model performance.\nDesign and communicate a practical data science project by posing meaningful questions, justifying method choices, acknowledging limitations, and presenting results with clear, reproducible materials and appropriate citation of external code and permitted generative AI use.",

You may think the teams who did the best relaxed on the 2nd quiz, and the teams who did poorly tried harder, and so forth.\nHowever, you DO NOT know if your team did well or poorly, comparing to other teams, right?!\nIt would be more accurate to say that some do better on this quiz than others, but the very best scores on the first quiz are from people who are both good and lucky. They will still probably do well on the second quiz, but most of them will not be so lucky the second time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionWhat does the regression coefficient \\(&lt; 1\\) mean in the heights example?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a parent is taller than the average, the regression predicts that his/her child is also taller than the average, but not as much as their parent.\nIf a parent is shorter than the average, the regression predicts that his/her child is also shorter than the average, but again not as much as their parent.\nTherefore, form one generation to the next, people’s heights have “regressed” to the average or mean, in statistics jargon."

We learn how to code for doing data science, not for understanding computer systems and structures.\n\n\nOf course we will not cover every detail form A to Z of DS in one semester becuase DS is such a huge subject, just like computer science.

I can totally understand how hard studying and living in another country. Feel free to share your stories or difficulties, and I am more than happy to help you if you have any questions.\nPoor listening and speaking skills. I was shy.\nOK so, this is my background. How about you introducing yourself as well. You can share anything, your major, hobbies, your favorite food, what do you want to do after graduation, anything,\nI have the class list. I’d like to learn your face and remember your name. You know, you all wear a mask. It’s hard to recognize you and connect your name and your face.\nWhen I call your name, you can say something about yourself. No need to be long, couple of seconds are good."

We learn how to code for doing data science, not for understanding computer systems and structures.\n\nOf course we will not cover every detail form A to Z of DS in one semester becuase DS is such a huge subject, just like computer science. It’s impossible to learn CS in one semester by just taking intro to CS, right? So we’ll just learn the basic and essential concepts and tools used is DS."

No more copy and paste.\nThis greatly saves lots of time. Also, it reduces the chance of making mistakes of copying and pasting, and increases reproducibility of your study, meaning that your code can produce exactly the same result shown in your document.\nLiterate Programming"

No more copy and paste.\nThis greatly saves lots of time. Also, it reduces the chance of making mistakes of copying and pasting, and increases reproducibility of your study, meaning that your code can produce exactly the same result shown in your document.\nLiterate Programming"

We can subset a list by name or by indexing.\nSuppose we want the first element of the list, we can get it by its name using x_lst$idx.\nWe can also obtain it by using indexing like x_lst[[1]] because we want the first element.\nNotice that the way we subset a list returns an integer vector, the real first element of the list, not a list.\nLet’s see another case on the right.\nWe can also subset by name using single pair of brackets, and put the name inside the brackets.\nOr we can subset by indexing, again using single pair of brackets.\nAnd you see what happened? The way we subset a list here returns a sub-list, not the element itself.\nSo please be careful when subsetting a list.\nIf you want a vector, use these ways. If you want to keep it as a list, use these ways."

When we subset a list, it may return an element of the list, or it returns a sub-list of the list.\nLet’s see how it happens.\nThis is our x_lst. We can subset a list by name or by indexing.\nSuppose we want the first element of the list, we can get it by its name using x_lst$idx.\nWe can also obtain it by using indexing like x_lst[[1]] because we want the first element.\nNotice that the way we subset a list returns an integer vector, the real first element of the list, not a list.\nLet’s see another case on the right.\nWe can also subset by name using single pair of brackets, and put the name inside the brackets.\nOr we can subset by indexing, again using single pair of brackets.\nAnd you see what happened? The way we subset a list here returns a sub-list, not the element itself.\nSo please be careful when subsetting a list.\nIf you want a vector, use these ways. If you want to keep it as a list, use these ways."
