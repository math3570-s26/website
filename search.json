What should I do in R or Python to import correctly and verify it”\n“The column last_review mixes formats like 2019-06-23, 06/24/2019, and 06/20/19. What is a safe parsing strategy and how do I report failures”\n“price contains values like $70, 70, and 60 dollars. What is a safe way to convert to numeric and validate the conversion”\n“minimum_nights includes values like 2 nights and availability_365 includes values like 0/365 or 96 days. How should I clean these and what checks should I run”\n“room_type and neighbourhood_group have inconsistent capitalization and whitespace. What cleaning steps are reasonable and how do I validate categories after cleaning”\n\n\n\n\nStep 3 Create the AI Interaction Log\nFor each prompt, include:\n\nPrompt goal\nThe AI response excerpt you used\nYour annotation:\n\nWhat AI got right\nWhat AI assumed\nWhat was missing, misleading, or incorrect\n\n\nImportant rule\n\nYou may not paste AI text into your final synthesis verbatim.\n\n\n\nStep 4 Import the dataset and run required validation checks\nImport the required file, then complete the validation checklist below. Your evidence can be screenshots, printed outputs, or short summaries of what you observed. A short summary without numbers or outputs does not count as evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteRequired post import validation checklist (expand to view)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Rows and columns\n\nConfirm the dataset has 600 rows and 16 columns after import.\n\n2. Missing value representations\n\nIdentify at least three different missing value representations present in the file (examples include blank cells, a period, unknown, an em dash).\nChoose two columns (recommended: last_review and reviews_per_month).\nReport how many missing values you see in each column, and explain how you defined missingness.\n\n3. Date column with mixed formats\n\nCheck last_review.\nShow evidence that more than one date format exists in the raw data.\nState whether your import tool parsed it as a date or left it as text.\nIf you parsed it, report how many non missing entries became missing after parsing.\n\n4. Numeric values stored as text\n\nChoose two columns from this list: price, minimum_nights, availability_365, reviews_per_month.\nShow the raw formats you observe (for example $70, 60 dollars, 2 nights, 0/365, 0.03 per mo).\nState what type your import tool assigned and what conversion would be required.\n\n5. Currency stored as text\n\nCheck price.\nShow at least three raw examples that are not purely numeric.\nState what conversion you would use and one validation check you would run after conversion.\n\n6. Categorical values with inconsistent formatting\n\nChoose neighbourhood_group or room_type.\nList the unique values you observe before cleaning (include at least 8 examples).\nPropose a cleaning rule (for example trim whitespace, standardize case, replace underscores).\nShow evidence of how categories change after cleaning (for example fewer unique levels or merged categories).\n\n7. Text encoding and non ASCII or invisible characters\n\nFind at least one host_name that contains a non ASCII character or an invisible character.\nShow evidence that the character displays correctly after import.\nState what could go wrong if encoding or invisible characters are not handled properly.\n\n8. Silent coercion risk\n\nIdentify one column where a reasonable but incorrect conversion could silently create wrong values or missing values.\nExplain the mistake, why it could be hard to notice, and how you would detect it using evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5 Write the Human Authored Synthesis (group)\nLength target: 400 to 600 words.\nYour synthesis must include:\n\nYour investigation question\nAt least two hidden assumptions with evidence from your validation checks\nA clear explanation of why the assumptions matter for later analysis\nA short recommended import and validation routine for this dataset type\n\nYour synthesis must be written in your own words.\n\n\nStep 6 Presentation slides (group)\nUse this exact slide structure:\n\nOur question\nWhat AI suggested\nWhere AI fell short\nOur corrected understanding, with evidence\nOne takeaway for future data science work\n\nTime: 12 to 15 minutes."

Since there is a column named xyz, the expression df$x will be expanded to df$xyz. This behavior of the $ operator saves a few keystrokes, but it can result in accidentally using a different column than you thought you were using.\n\nWith [ the type of object that is returned differs on the number of columns. If it is one column, it won’t return a data.frame, but instead will return a vector. With more than one column, then it will return a data.frame. This is fine if you know what you are passing in, but suppose you did df[ , vars] where vars was a variable. Then what that code does depends on length(vars) and you’d have to write code to account for those situations or risk bugs.\n\nFor tibbles,\n\nWhen using the matrix subsetting method, a tibble always return a tibble.\n\n\nWhen using $ to grab an element, tibbles never do partial matching.\n\n\n[] always returns another tibble, regardless of list or matrix subsetting method.\n\n\n$ and [[]] return a vector.\n\n\nTibbles never do partial matching and name “x” cannot be recognized.\n\n\nWhat does tibble::enframe() do? Try enframe(c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)). Check ?enframe for more details.\nThe function tibble::enframe() converts named vectors to a data frame with names and values\n\n\niris |&gt; tail(n = 12) |&gt; summary()\n\n  Sepal.Length    Sepal.Width     Petal.Length    Petal.Width   \n Min.   :5.800   Min.   :2.500   Min.   :4.800   Min.   :1.800  \n 1st Qu.:6.150   1st Qu.:3.000   1st Qu.:5.100   1st Qu.:1.900  \n Median :6.600   Median :3.050   Median :5.200   Median :2.200  \n Mean   :6.450   Mean   :3.033   Mean   :5.292   Mean   :2.133  \n 3rd Qu.:6.725   3rd Qu.:3.125   3rd Qu.:5.450   3rd Qu.:2.300  \n Max.   :6.900   Max.   :3.400   Max.   :5.900   Max.   :2.500  \n       Species  \n setosa    : 0  \n versicolor: 0  \n virginica :12"

    "text": "Step-by-step tasks\n\nStep 1 Define your investigation question (before using AI)\nWrite 2 to 3 sentences answering:\n\nWhat import problem are we investigating\nWhy this problem matters in real data science\n\nYou must focus on hidden assumptions, for example assumptions about missing values, types, dates, or text encoding.\n\n\nStep 2 Use AI strategically (3 to 5 prompts)\nYour prompts must be purposeful and iterative.\n[Note:] You may run several prompts, but keep 5 most useful and meaningful prompts for reporting.\nPrompt requirements\n\nAt least 1 prompt about missing values and missing value tokens\nAt least 1 prompt about type guessing and type coercion risks\nAt least 1 prompt about date parsing and mixed date formats\nAt least 1 prompt about validation steps after import\n\n\nSuggested prompt starters (you may adapt)\n\n“I am importing a CSV where missing values appear as blank, NA, N A, N slash A, and a period. What should I do in R or Python to import correctly and verify it”\n“What are the most common silent errors from automatic type guessing during CSV import”\n“If a date column mixes formats like YYYY MM DD and MM slash DD slash YYYY, what should I check after import”\n“Give me a post import validation checklist for columns that look numeric but are stored as text, such as currency and percentages”\n\n\n\n\nStep 3 Create the AI Interaction Log\nFor each prompt, include:\n\nPrompt goal\nThe AI response excerpt you used\nYour annotation:\n\nWhat AI got right\nWhat AI assumed\nWhat was missing, misleading, or incorrect\n\n\nImportant rule\n\nYou may not paste AI text into your final synthesis verbatim.\n\n\n\nStep 4 Import the dataset and run required validation checks\nImport the required file, then complete the validation checklist below. Your evidence can be screenshots, printed outputs, or short summaries of what you observed. A short summary without numbers or outputs does not count as evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteRequired post import validation checklist (expand to view)\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit evidence for every item.\n1. Rows and columns\n\nConfirm the dataset has 600 rows and 79 columns after import.\n\n2. Missing value tokens\n\nIdentify at least three different missing value representations present in the file (examples include NA, N slash A, blank, period).\nReport how many appear in at least two columns of your choice.\n\n3. Date columns\n\nIdentify at least two date columns (examples include last_scraped, host_since).\nShow evidence that more than one date format exists in the data.\nState whether your import tool parsed them as dates or left them as text.\n\n4. Percent columns stored as text\n\nCheck host_response_rate and host_acceptance_rate.\nShow the raw format you observe (for example values that include a percent sign).\nState what type your import tool assigned and what conversion would be required.\n\n5. Currency stored as text\n\nCheck the price column.\nShow the raw format you observe (for example dollar sign and commas).\nState what type your import tool assigned and what conversion would be required.\n\n6. Logical values coded as text\n\nCheck host_is_superhost.\nList the unique values you observe (for example t and f).\nState what type your import tool assigned and what conversion would be required.\n\n7. Text encoding and non ASCII characters\n\nFind at least one host_name that contains non ASCII characters (examples include accented letters).\nShow evidence that the character displays correctly after import.\nState what could go wrong if encoding is not handled properly.\n\n8. Silent type coercion risk\n\nIdentify one column where automatic guessing could lead to a silent mistake.\nExplain the mistake, why it could be hard to notice, and how you would detect it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5 Write the Human-Authored Synthesis (group)\nLength target: 400 to 600 words.\nYour synthesis must include:\n\nYour investigation question\nAt least two hidden assumptions with evidence from your validation checks\nA clear explanation of why the assumptions matter for later analysis\nA short recommended import and validation routine for this dataset type\n\nYour synthesis must be written in your own words.\n\n\nStep 6 Presentation slides (group)\nUse this exact slide structure:\n\nOur question\nWhat AI suggested\nWhere AI fell short\nOur corrected understanding, with evidence\nOne takeaway for future data science work\n\nTime: 12 to 15 minutes.",

When we subset a list, it may return an element of the list, or it returns a sub-list of the list.\nLet’s see how it happens.\nThis is our x_lst. We can subset a list by name or by indexing.\nSuppose we want the first element of the list, we can get it by its name using x_lst$idx.\nWe can also obtain it by using indexing like x_lst[[1]] because we want the first element.\nNotice that the way we subset a list returns an integer vector, the real first element of the list, not a list.\nLet’s see another case on the right.\nWe can also subset by name using single pair of brackets, and put the name inside the brackets.\nOr we can subset by indexing, again using single pair of brackets.\nAnd you see what happened? The way we subset a list here returns a sub-list, not the element itself.\nSo please be careful when subsetting a list.\nIf you want a vector, use these ways. If you want to keep it as a list, use these ways."

The way we subset a list here returns a sub-list, not the element itself.\nSo please be careful when subsetting a list.\nIf you want a vector, use these ways.

No more copy and paste.\nThis greatly saves lots of time. Also, it reduces the chance of making mistakes of copying and pasting, and increases reproducibility of your study, meaning that your code can produce exactly the same result shown in your document.\nLiterate Programming"

No more copy and paste.\nThis greatly saves lots of time. Also, it reduces the chance of making mistakes of copying and pasting, and increases reproducibility of your study, meaning that your code can produce exactly the same result shown in your document.\nLiterate Programming"

That makes transforming tidy data feel natural.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractical instructions:\n\nPut each dataset in a data frame.\n\n\nPut each variable in a column.\n\n\n\n\nThese three rules are interrelated; it’s impossible to only satisfy two of the three.\nRemember, “Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.”\n\nRemember, R prefer vectorized programming style. If each variable corresponds to a column vector, it is easy to transform variables using vectorised functions.\nWe will learn how to make our data tidy using tidyr, dplyr and other packages in Data Wrangling weeks."

Polars is often 10x to 100x faster than Pandas because it uses all your CPU cores. Polars’ “Expression API” is more structured. It discourages the “spaghetti code” that can sometimes happen with Pandas’ .iloc, .loc, and nested brackets. Polars has excellent support for reading Parquet, IPC, and CSV files directly from cloud storage or scanning them lazily to save time. Polars demonstrates clear performance gains over Pandas for medium and large datasets, especially for group-by and column selection. For smaller datasets (10,000 rows), Pandas can occasionally be faster in simpler operations like filtering, but Polars still shows advantages in more complex tasks like joins and large-scale aggregations."

Polars is often 10x to 100x faster than Pandas because it uses all your CPU cores. Polars’ “Expression API” is more structured. It discourages the “spaghetti code” that can sometimes happen with Pandas’ .iloc, .loc, and nested brackets. Polars has excellent support for reading Parquet, IPC, and CSV files directly from cloud storage or scanning them lazily to save time. Polars demonstrates clear performance gains over Pandas for medium and large datasets, especially for group-by and column selection. For smaller datasets (10,000 rows), Pandas can occasionally be faster in simpler operations like filtering, but Polars still shows advantages in more complex tasks like joins and large-scale aggregations."

It can create lots of graphs that the other two cannot, and ggplot2 is more beautiful than the other two, I think.

And if we want to use the same scatter plot but with a different labels or any other features, just add the new labels or features to the object “p”.\nSo this way we don’t need to type the basic ggplot structure all over again.\nIt’s quite useful if you wanna generate the same plot but with different decorations.

Now I want to talk about the difference between mapping and setting.\nFirst, the aesthetic options such as color, size, shape, alpha can be used in both mapping and setting.\nWhen we use these options in mapping arguments, wrapped by aes() function, we actually map these options to some variables. In other words, we use those options to represents the values of the variables. Like here, the point size is used to represent the city mpg, the different point transparency are for different car years.\nSo there is a mapping between aesthetics options and variables.\nAlright setting. When we use the aesthetics options as a geometry setting, the aesthetics are pure decoration of your plot, the aesthetics are not used to represent any other variable values.\nLook at the example here. If we want to set point size at 5 and point transparency at 0.5, we put size = 5, alpha = 0.5 in the geometry function geom_point(), not in the mapping argument.\nAnd the result is that, all the points in the scatter plot will have size 5 and alpha 0.5. And it is true for all observations and variables. It is not related to any other variables as mapping does. OK."

Now I want to talk about the difference between mapping and setting.\nFirst, the aesthetic options such as color, size, shape, alpha can be used in both mapping and setting.\nWhen we use these options in mapping arguments, wrapped by aes() function, we actually map these options to some variables. In other words, we use those options to represents the values of the variables. Like here, the point size is used to represent the city mpg, the different point transparency are for different car years.\nSo there is a mapping between aesthetics options and variables.\nAlright setting. When we use the aesthetics options as a geometry setting, the aesthetics are pure decoration of your plot, the aesthetics are not used to represent any other variable values.\nLook at the example here. If we want to set point size at 5 and point transparency at 0.5, we put size = 5, alpha = 0.5 in the geometry function geom_point(), not in the mapping argument.\nAnd the result is that, all the points in the scatter plot will have size 5 and alpha 0.5. And it is true for all observations and variables. It is not related to any other variables as mapping does. OK."

In row 6 and col x, we expect a double but it is actually a dot or period, which is a character, and so R treats it as NA, which is exactly what I want to do.\nBut R send a message telling us about this, and make sure this is what we want to do.\nThis option might be preferable if you cannot scan your data file, or don;t know what convention is being used for missing values in your data file, but you happen to know your column types.\nThe downside of this is that, here, Not applicable and 9999, they are all treated as valid character values, and they are not missing values.

    "text": "This course introduces main aspects of doing a practical data science project, from importing data to deploying what is learned from data. We start with learning popular data science tools such as basic R and Python programming, Git and GitHub, and interactive publishing system Quarto. Then we learn data importing, data visualization and data wrangling using both R and Python. The second half of the course focuses on several basic simulation and machine learning methods, including Monte Carlo simulation, linear regression, K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, principal component analysis, and K-means clustering. We learn R tidyverse and tidymodels packages. For Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn libraries are introduced.\n\nLearning outcomes\nBy the end of the course, students will be able to:\n\nExecute a reproducible data science workflow using R and Python with Quarto and version control practices (Git and GitHub) to produce, share, and update analyses.\nImport, clean, reshape, and visualize data to create effective representations that support exploration and decision making.\nApply machine learning and statistical modeling methods including simulation and core supervised and unsupervised learning tools to detect patterns and evaluate model performance.\nDesign and communicate a practical data science project by posing meaningful questions, justifying method choices, acknowledging limitations, and presenting results with clear, reproducible materials and appropriate citation of external code and permitted generative AI use.",

    "text": "“Regression” is defined in the dictionary as “the process or returning to a former or less developed state.” How did this term come to be used for statistical prediction? This connection comes from Francis Galton, one of the original quantitative social scientists, who fit linear models to under stand the heredity of human height. Predicting children’s heights from parent’s heights, he noticed that children of tall parents tended to be taller than average but less tall than their parents. From the other direction, children of shorter parents tended to be shorter than average but less short than their parents. Thus, from one generation to the next, people’s heights have “regressed” to the average or mean, in statistics jargon. 1\n\nThe following activities demonstrate regression to the mean."

You may think the teams who did the best relaxed on the 2nd quiz, and the teams who did poorly tried harder, and so forth.\nHowever, you DO NOT know if your team did well or poorly, comparing to other teams, right?!\nIt would be more accurate to say that some do better on this quiz than others, but the very best scores on the first quiz are from people who are both good and lucky. They will still probably do well on the second quiz, but most of them will not be so lucky the second time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionWhat does the regression coefficient \\(&lt; 1\\) mean in the heights example?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a parent is taller than the average, the regression predicts that his/her child is also taller than the average, but not as much as their parent.\nIf a parent is shorter than the average, the regression predicts that his/her child is also shorter than the average, but again not as much as their parent.\nTherefore, form one generation to the next, people’s heights have “regressed” to the average or mean, in statistics jargon."

Another way we can visualize numerical data is using a density plot.\nA density plot is basically a smoothed version of a histogram.\nRemember that a continuous random variable has a continuous probability distribution that is a density curve as a plot. Right?\nSo a normal r.v. has a normal density curve that this.\nBut given a data set of continuous variable, we can only draw a histogram that is sort of an approximation to its density curve. The histogram will only be very much like its true density plot when the data size is huge or approaching to infinity.\nA density plot here smooths the histogram, telling us that given the data set we have, what the true density curve might look like.\nIn ggplot, we have geometry geom_density() to create a density plot.\nAnd ggplot uses the so-called kernel density estimation to smooth the histogram. The kernel is not a the linux kernel in computer science. The kernel here is a probability distribution.\nIf you are interested, it will be taught in 4750 Computational Statistics which is a new course starting this fall.\nYou can see in the graph that the density curve smooths the histogram, but it;s still not very smooth, right. It’s a little bit jagged.\nThe ggplot choose a level of smoothness for us. And we can adjust the smoothness by ourselves."

You as a reasearcher or data analyst have to figure out if it is typo, or it is the true interest rate. If it is a correct number, why such low interest rate happened?\nAnd to create such side-by-side boxplot, we just add y mapping, setting it to grade."

The histogram will only be very much like its true density plot when the data size is huge or approaching to infinity.\nA density plot here smooths the histogram, telling us that given the data set we have, what the true density curve might look like.\nIn ggplot, we have geometry geom_density() to create a density plot.\nAnd ggplot uses the so-called kernel density estimation to smooth the histogram. The kernel is not a the linux kernel in computer science. The kernel here is a probability distribution.\nIf you are interested, it will be taught in 4750 Computational Statistics which is a new course starting this fall.\nYou can see in the graph that the density curve smooths the histogram, but it;s still not very smooth, right.

You as a reasearcher or data analyst have to figure out if it is typo, or it is the true interest rate.

Actually this is a really hard question to answer, at least at this moment.\n\nOriginally, DS was proposed to replace statistics. DS is just another name or maybe better name for statistics.\n\n\nBut still at that time, nobody cares. Statisticians are weird guys in math departments who deal with proofs and theorems and sometimes real data, and they are stubborn, not willing to change. But if you wiki the definition of statistics, statistics is a science of data, and you tell me what is the difference of science of data and data science?\n\n\nUsing this definition, DS becomes a broader term than statistics. Anything related to data can be a part of data sicence, while statistics now becomes a narrower subject focusing on inference and data analysis part.\n\nHere shows the google trend of DS. When I was in college or beginning of PHD studies, very few people used DS as a term. And all of sudden, DS become more and more popular, and everybody is talking about it."

    "text": "A Little History of Data Science\n\nIn 1985, Dr. Jeff Wu used the term Data Science for the first time as an alternative name for Statistics.  \n\n\n\n\nThe first question is What is DS? Actually this is a really hard question to answer, at least at this moment.\n\nOriginally, DS was proposed to replace statistics. DS is just another name or maybe better name for statistics.\n\n\nBut still at that time, nobody cares. Statisticians are weird guys in math departments who deal with proofs and theorems and sometimes real data, and they are stubborn, not willing to change. But if you wiki the definition of statistics, statistics is a science of data, and you tell me what is the difference of science of data and data science?\n\n\nUsing this definition, DS becomes a broader term than statistics. Anything related to data can be a part of data sicence, while statistics now becomes a narrower subject focusing on inference and data analysis part.\n\nHere shows the google trend of DS. When I was in college or beginning of PHD studies, very few people used DS as a term. And all of sudden, DS become more and more popular, and everybody is talking about it."

Feel free to share your stories or difficulties, and I am more than happy to help you if you have any questions.\nPoor listening and speaking skills. I was shy.\nOK so, this is my background. How about you introducing yourself as well. You can share anything, your major, hobbies, your favorite food, what do you want to do after graduation, anything,\nI have the class list. I’d like to learn your face and remember your name. You know, you all wear a mask. It’s hard to recognize you and connect your name and your face.\nWhen I call your name, you can say something about yourself. No need to be long, couple of seconds are good."

At the end, it’s everything like final, final3, final10, final_last whatever, it just keeps going.\nThe thing is these file names are not really very informative because final or final revisions don’t really say anything.\nBut if you really had tagged the changes you make between the final and the final 2, that could actually be informative if you actually have to go back to them."

Git and GitHub are two different things.\nGit is a version control system like Track Changes features from Microsoft Word, but it is much more powerful.\nBasically Git helps us keep track of changes or progress of projects, so we can more easily manage our project because we can check what we did on our project on any given day.\nI’ll talk more about version control in a minute.\nGitHub is the home for Git-based projects (repository, or repo) on the internet – like Dropbox but much better.\nOnce we put those projects on the cloud in GitHub, we share our projects with others, usually our collaborators, or the entire team, so every team member can work on this project, make changes, and Git and GitHub will record who, when, and what the changes are made.\nI don’t need to teach you data science this way, but I hope you will appreciate I introduce git/github to you because knowing version control is really important for a developer."

And you go back and forth lots of times. At the end, it’s everything like final, final3, final10, final_last whatever, it just keeps going.\nThe thing is these file names are not really very informative because final or final revisions don’t really say anything.\nBut if you really had tagged the changes you make between the final and the final 2, that could actually be informative if you actually have to go back to them."

And that’s probably why you don’t learn R in an intro programming course.\nSo you can view Python as a smart phone. It can do many different things, phone, camera, email, social media. But R is like a high quality camera. You cannot use it to write emails, text messages, but it produces high quality photos.\nRStudio is not a programming language, but a software application.\nCode itself is just a text file. You can use any text editor or software to write your code.\nSo RStudio makes programming in R more easily and efficiently. It provides so many useful functions for you that doing data science becomes a piece of cake.\nToday, You are gonna have a chance to play with different panes and functions in RStudio. OK."

    "section": "Step by step tasks",
    "text": "Step by step tasks\n\nStep 1 Define your investigation question (before using AI)\nWrite 2 to 3 sentences that answer these four questions:\n\nWhat is the analysis task you want to do (choose one: a summary table, a visualization, or a model input)\nWhat is the main outcome you care about (examples: mean_price, median_minimum_nights, mean_availability_365, mean_reviews_per_month, n_listings)\nWhat comparison do you want to make (examples: compare room types within a neighborhood, compare neighborhoods within a borough, compare multiple metrics for one room type)\nWhy your task requires a specific tidy format\n\nYour question must be specific enough that you can argue for two different tidy representations and then choose one.\nExample investigation questions you may use or adapt:\n\n“I want to make a plot that compares mean_price across room_type within each neighbourhood_group. I think tidy version A is better because it gives one row per neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, and room_type with a mean_price column ready to plot.”\n“I want to compare multiple metrics for each room_type in one visualization. I think tidy version B is better because it has a metric column and a value column, which makes it easy to facet or color by metric.”\n“I want to prepare the data for a simple model where mean_price is predicted by room_type and neighbourhood_group. I think tidy version A is better because each row is one observation unit with clear predictor columns.”\n\n\n\nStep 2 Use AI strategically (3 to 5 prompts)\n[Note:] You may run several prompts, but keep 5 most useful and meaningful prompts for reporting.\nYour prompts must be purposeful and iterative.\nPrompt requirements\n\nAt least 1 prompt asking AI to explain why the provided dataset is untidy, using tidy data rules\nAt least 1 prompt asking AI to propose a tidy target for a specific analysis goal you choose\nAt least 1 prompt asking AI to reshape the data using a concrete plan, for example pivot_longer then pivot_wider\nAt least 1 prompt asking AI for verification checks after reshaping\n\n\nSuggested prompt starters (you may adapt)\n\n*“Here is a dataset where the column names look like mean_price__Private_room and mean_availability_365__Shared_room. Explain why this is untidy, using tidy data rules.”*\n“Give two different tidy formats for this dataset, one that is best for modeling, and one that is best for visualization. Explain why.”\n“Write a step by step plan in R to reshape this dataset so that each row is one neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, and room_type, with separate columns for mean_price, median_minimum_nights, mean_availability_365, mean_reviews_per_month, and n_listings.”\n“After reshaping, what sanity checks can prove that I did not accidentally change the meaning of the data”\n“If some room types are missing in some neighborhoods, how should that appear in a tidy data set, and how should I report it”\n\n\n\n\nStep 3 Create the AI Interaction Log\nFor each prompt, include:\n\nPrompt goal\nThe AI response excerpt you used\nYour annotation:\n\nWhat AI got right\nWhat AI assumed\nWhat was missing, misleading, or incorrect\nHow you revised your prompt or your plan\n\n\nImportant rule\n\nYou may not paste AI text into your final synthesis verbatim.\n\n\n\nStep 4 Reshape the dataset and run required validation checks\nReshape the required file, then complete the validation checklist below. Your evidence can be screenshots, printed outputs, or short summaries of what you observed. A short summary without numbers or outputs does not count as evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteRequired reshaping and validation checklist (expand to view)\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Rows and columns in the original data\n\nConfirm the dataset has 15 rows and 17 columns after import.\n\n2. Identify at least three untidy features\nUse tidy data rules and point to concrete evidence from this file. Examples of valid untidy features include:\n\nTwo variables are encoded in the column names\nSome variables are spread across many columns instead of stored in one column\nMissing values appear because some room types are absent in some neighborhoods, which can be hard to see in wide format\n\n3. Create tidy version A, best for modeling and tabular summaries\nTarget structure\n\nOne row per neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, and room_type\nSeparate columns for: mean_price, median_minimum_nights, mean_availability_365, mean_reviews_per_month, n_listings\n\nEvidence to submit\n\nThe row and column count of tidy version A\nThe list of column names of tidy version A\n\n4. Create tidy version B, best for visualization across metrics\nTarget structure\n\nOne row per neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, room_type, and metric\nA single value column\n\nEvidence to submit\n\nThe row and column count of tidy version B\nThe list of unique values in the metric column\n\n5. Sanity checks that meaning did not change\nProvide evidence for at least two checks, for example:\n\nFor one neighborhood, show that a value like mean_price for Private_room is the same before and after reshaping\nShow that the total number of non missing cells in the wide table equals the number of rows in tidy version A for each metric room_type combination\nShow that the number of missing combinations you report is consistent between formats\n\n6. Choice and justification\nWrite 3 to 5 sentences answering:\n\nWhich tidy version is better for your investigation question\nWhy the other tidy version is less convenient for that goal\nWhat would make the other tidy version the better choice in a different situation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5 Write the Human Authored Synthesis (group)\nLength target: 400 to 600 words.\nYour synthesis must include:\n\nYour investigation question\nAt least two meaningful choices, assumptions, or limitations, supported by evidence from your checklist\nA clear explanation of why tidy rules alone were not enough for this case\nA short recommended decision process for choosing a tidy format\n\nYour synthesis must be written in your own words.\n\n\nStep 6 Presentation slides (group)\nUse this exact slide structure:\n\nOur question\nWhat AI suggested\nWhere AI fell short\nOur corrected understanding, with evidence\nOne takeaway for future data science work\n\nTime: 12 to 15 minutes."

Each prompt has a specific learning goal, and follow-up prompts show refinement based on prior AI responses.\n18–20\n\n\nCompetent\nPrompts are reasonable and relevant but mostly one-shot or broad. Limited evidence of iteration or strategic refinement.\n14–17\n\n\nDeveloping\nPrompts are vague, generic, or copied. Little connection between prompts and learning goals.\n8–13\n\n\nInsufficient\nPrompts are missing, inappropriate, or unrelated to the assigned topic.\n0–7\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation of AI Use (AI Interaction Log) (15 points)\nEvaluates: Transparency and completeness of AI documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nDescription\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nExcellent\nAI interaction log is complete, well-organized, and clearly annotated. Goals, strengths, and limitations of AI responses are explicitly documented.\n14–15\n\n\nCompetent\nAI interaction log is mostly complete with basic annotations. Some explanations lack depth or clarity.\n11–13\n\n\nDeveloping\nAI interaction log is incomplete or weakly annotated. Limited explanation of AI strengths or limitations.\n6–10\n\n\nInsufficient\nAI use is poorly documented, unclear, or missing.\n0–5\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical Evaluation of AI Output (25 points)\nEvaluates: Ability to question, critique, and challenge AI responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nDescription\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nExcellent\nClearly identifies specific limitations, assumptions, or errors in AI output and explains why they matter using statistical reasoning.\n23–25\n\n\nCompetent\nIdentifies some limitations or weaknesses in AI output, but explanations are partial or underdeveloped.\n18–22\n\n\nDeveloping\nMentions limitations superficially or inconsistently.

Demonstrates strong statistical reasoning and clearly improves upon AI output.\n27–30\n\n\nCompetent\nExplanation is mostly accurate and understandable but adds limited insight beyond AI output. Minor gaps or imprecision.\n21–26\n\n\nDeveloping\nExplanation shows partial understanding, conceptual gaps, or heavy reliance on AI phrasing.\n12–20\n\n\nInsufficient\nExplanation is incorrect, unclear, or largely AI-generated with minimal human synthesis.\n0–11\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunication and Presentation Quality (10 points)\nEvaluates: Clarity and structure of the group presentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nDescription\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nExcellent\nPresentation is well-structured, clear, and focused on reasoning. Effectively explains what AI missed and what the group learned.\n9–10\n\n\nCompetent\nPresentation is understandable but uneven or overly descriptive. Some focus on content rather than reasoning.\n7–8\n\n\nDeveloping\nPresentation lacks clarity or structure. Key points are unclear or poorly explained.\n4–6\n\n\nInsufficient\nPresentation is disorganized, incomplete, or difficult to follow.\n0–3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual Adjustment (Reflection-Based)\nIndividual reflections may be used to adjust individual scores up or down if:\n\nA student demonstrates substantially stronger or weaker understanding than the group product suggests\nA student did not meaningfully contribute to the group’s work",
