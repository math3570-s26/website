Thanks for visiting the profile page of FreeStand Home Solutions! 

We here at FHS, operate a corporate housing company, which means businesses and companies contract with us for housing, which typically averages 5-6 months.

We are NOT in the business of vacation renting. 

We simply list on these platforms because this is where businesses and companies come to search for housing.

Due to the nature of our business, we allow these same companies to ""extend"" their stay if they issue a request, 21 days prior to their lease expiration. 

If you are seeking long-term housing (30+ days), please submit an inquiry. Even if we do not have availability, we have additional temp housing companies we can recommend. We also have 50+ homes, so we are able to recommend an open location.

If you are seeking short-term housing (less than 30 days), we have a partner we work with, who may have availability. 

Please reach out to our office with additional questions, support and inquiries.
Pricing & calendar availability is accurate on FHS website only.

I am a well travelled guy who has been all over the world. I am a true budget traveller and that is why I set up this profile and my condo to answer to the needs of the traveller who share the same values as I do. I enjoy meeting and hosting travelers from all walks of life and every corner of the globe.

I always keep my place clean. After hosting and being hosted in different places by different people, I realized that not everybody has the same manners or understanding. Or not everybody was thought basic manners at home when they were young. 

The whole purpose of setting this profile was *to help* people and give back a little to return the good karma that was given to me by others. I know I am helping to people and *giving them a deal*, so remember that if you appreciate my hospitality you can always come back. My intent is to create a pool of regular guests and future friendships based on this.

I am a very caring and considerate host; also I am a very busy person and my life does not shape around Airbnb and I do this as a hobby. If I decline your request without providing a reason, it means I am either travelling for work or using the place for other purposes. Do not seek other meanings behind that.

Good luck.",within an hour,100%,47%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/19518653/profile_pic/1407265037/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/19518653/profile_pic/1407265037/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Irving Park,2.0,2.0,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,Neighborhood highlights,Irving Park,,41.9475396,-87.70692059999999,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,4,1.0,1 bath,2.0,2.0,"[""Wifi"", ""Blender"", ""Conditioner"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Freezer"", ""Essentials"", ""Iron"", ""Free street parking"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Clothing storage"", ""Shower gel"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Bed linens"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Laundromat nearby"", ""Hangers"", ""Stove"", ""Host greets you"", ""Dining table"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Private entrance"", ""Heating"", ""Bathtub"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Hot water"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Microwave"", ""TV"", ""Oven"", ""Kitchen"", ""Body soap"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Shampoo"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Long term stays allowed""]",$134.00,2,365,2.0,3.0,365.0,365.0,2.1,365.0,,t,24,54,67,174,2025-09-23,53,23,3,67,31,138,18492.0,2023-12-03,2025-09-21,4.87,4.89,4.89,4.81,4.81,4.83,4.85,R23000111108,f,2,2,0,0,2.41
