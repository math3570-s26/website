- Hello everyone, how are you? I hope you have a great winter break. Welcome to 3570 Introduction to Data Science course. I am your instructor Cheng-Han Yu.  

- First thing first. Get to know each other. Let me first introduce my self. I was born and grew up in Taipei, Taiwan, my home country, which is a island right next to China. Taipei is a big city in terms of population. It is about the same population size as Chicago. This building is called Taipei 101, which is the tallest building in Taiwan.

::: notes
After college, working and doing military service for several years, I came to the US for my PhD degree. Originally I would like to study economics, but then I switched my major to statistics. 

- I got my master degree in economics from Indiana University Bloomington, then I transferred to UC Santa Cruz to finish my PhD studies. 
- Then I spent two years doing my postdoctoral research at Rice University in Houston, Texas.
- Finally, in fall 2020, I came to Marquette as an assistant professor.
- Midwest/Indiana-West/California-South/Texas-Midwest/Wisconsin
- Been to any one of these universities/cities? 
- The most beautiful campus.
- Who are international students? I can totally understand how hard studying and living in another country. Feel free to share your stories or difficulties, and I am more than happy to help you if you have any questions.
- Poor listening and speaking skills. I was shy. 
- OK so, this is my background. How about you introducing yourself as well. You can share anything, your major, hobbies, your favorite food, what do you want to do after graduation, anything, 
- I have the class list. I'd like to learn your face and remember your name. You know, you all wear a mask. It's hard to recognize you and connect your name and your face. 
- When I call your name, you can say something about yourself. No need to be long, couple of seconds are good.

::: notes
- This is a real case happened last semester. A student of my class sent her homework of another class linear systems to me because the instructor of that course also has last name Yu, and she messed up. So if you remember to add course number in the subject line, it will greatly reduce the possibility of sending a wrong message. And it will save your time and my time, and so we all can work more efficiently. Right?

## What is This Course?
- **Every** *aspect of doing a practical data science project, from importing data to deploying what we learn from data*.
 
 
. . .

`r emo::ji("question")` **What are prerequisites?**  
`r emo::ji("point_right")` COSC 1010 (Intro Programming) and MATH 4720 (Intro Stats) or MATH 2780 (Intro Regression)

<br>

. . .

`r emo::ji("question")` **Is this like another intro stats course?**  
`r emo::ji("point_right")` No. Statistics and data science are closely related.  

. . .

Nowadays  
`r emo::ji("point_right")` Data science is a *broader* subject than statistics.  

. . .

`r emo::ji("point_right")` Statistics focuses more on *analyzing and learning from data*, a part of the entire workflow of data science.


<br>

. . .


`r emo::ji("question")` **Is this like another intro CS or programming course?**  
`r emo::ji("point_right")` Absolutely not. We learn how to **code for doing data science**, not for understanding computer systems and structures.

::: notes
- Of course we will not cover every detail form A to Z of DS in one semester becuase DS is such a huge subject, just like computer science. It's impossible to learn CS in one semester by just taking intro to CS, right? So we'll just learn the basic and essential concepts and tools used is DS.

- Check your grade: **Assessments > Grades**

- New announcement: **News**



## Grading Policy &#x2728;

- Your grade is from the following categories and distribution

  +   **25%** In-class lab activities
  
  +   **10%** In-class AI activities
  
  +   **45%** Mini projects
  
  +   **20%** Final project competition

  

<!-- Depending on the progress of the course,  -->
<!-- - There may be a midterm project proposal presentation, if time permitted.  -->
- `r emo::ji("x")` You must participate in the final presentation in order to pass the course.

- `r emo::ji("x")` You will **NOT** be allowed to do any extra credit projects/homework/exam to compensate for a poor grade.

<!-- - I may use class participation to make grade adjustments at the end of the semester. -->


## Grade-Percentage Conversion

- $[x, y)$ means greater than or equal to $x$ and less than $y$. For example, 94.0 is in [94, 100] and the grade is A and 93.8 is in [90, 94) and the grade is A-.

```{r}
letter <- c("A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-",
                       "D+", "D", "F")
percentage <- c("[94, 100]", "[90, 94)", "[87, 90)", "[84, 87)", "[80, 84)",
                "[77, 80)", "[74, 77)", "[70, 74)", 
                "[65, 70)", "[60, 65)", "[0, 60)")
grade_dist <- data.frame(Grade = letter, Percentage = percentage)
library(kableExtra)
knitr::kable(grade_dist, longtable = TRUE, format = "html", align = 'l') %>% kable_styling(position = "center", font_size = 36)
```


## Lab Exercises (25%)

- Graded as **Complete/Incomplete** and used as evidence of attendance and participation.

- Allowed to have **one** incomplete lab exercise without any penalty.

- Beyond that, **2%** grade percentage will be taken off for each missing/incomplete exercise.

- You will create a project in [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud) saving all of your lab exercises. (We'll go through know-how together)

<!-- - `r emo::ji("x")` **No make-up lab exercises** for any reason. -->


<!-- ## Homework (30%) -->

<!-- - The homework assignments are individual. Submit your own work.  -->

<!-- - `r emo::ji("x")` **You may not share answers/code with your classmates**. -->

<!-- . . . -->

<!-- - Homework will be assigned through [**GitHub**](https://github.com/):  -->
<!--   + clone/pull the homework repo into Posit Cloud -->
<!--   + work on the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) file in the repo (We'll go through know-how together) -->

<!-- . . . -->

<!-- - You will have **at least one week** to complete your assignment. -->

<!-- - `r emo::ji("x")` **No make-up homework** for any reason unless you have [excused absence](https://bulletin.marquette.edu/policies/attendance/undergraduate/). `r emo::ji("pray")` -->


## AI activities (10%)

- AI activities are short presentations during class. They are usually graded as **complete or incomplete**.

- AI activities are used as evidence of both attendance and participation.

- Groups take turn to present what they learn from GenAI about data science.


## Mini Projects (45%)

- You will work in a team on **3** mini projects. 

- This project will focus on a subset of the course content up to that point, for example data wrangling and visualization or a simple predictive model.

<!-- - The mini projects will include -->

<!--   + A documented GitHub repository. -->
<!--   + A Quarto report describing your question, data, methods, and findings. -->
<!--   + A short in-class group presentation. -->
<!--   + An AI usage documents that shows how you used generative AI and how you verified any AI generated content. -->

- More detailed instructions and rubric will be provided later in the semester.

## Final Project Competition (20%)

- You will be team up to do the final project.

- Your project can be in either of the following categories:
    1.  **Data analysis** using statistical models or machine learning algorithms

    2.  Introduce a **R or Python package** not learned in class, including **live demo**

    3.  Introduce a **data science tool (visualization, computing, etc)** not learned in class, including **live demo**
    
    4.  Introduce a **programming language** not learned in class for doing data science, including **live demo**, Julia, SQL, MATLAB, SAS for example.
    
    5.  **Web development**: Shiny website or dashboard, including **live demo**


- The final project presentation is on **Monday, 5/4, 10:30 AM - 12:30 PM**.

- More information will be released later.




<!-- ## AI Project (150 pts) -->

<!-- - There will be one AI project released around Week 13. -->

<!-- - You have to use GenAI to self learn a topic that is not covered in my lectures, and generate a data analysis report. -->

<!-- - The project topic will also be tested in the final exam. -->

<!-- - You **must carefully cite your GenAI tool or reveal your use of AI.** -->



## Document Generative AI Use


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="80%"}

<!-- ### Generative AI -->

- You may use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Gemini to generate a first draft of text for your work, provided that this use is **documented and cited**.

<!-- [Example] Data science is an interdisciplinary field that ... [^1] -->

<!-- [^1]: ChatGPT, response to *“Tell me what data science is,”* Jan 14, 2025, https://chat.openai.com. -->
