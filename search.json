All students have the same opportunities to succeed. Class participation may be used for grade adjustments at the end of the semester.\nThe final grade is based on the grade-percentage conversion Table 1 on the next page. \\([x, y)\\) means greater than or equal to \\(x\\) and less than \\(y\\). For example, 94.1 is in \\([94, 100]\\) and the grade is A and 93.8 is in \\([90, 94)\\) and the grade is A-.\n\n\n\n\nGrade-Percentage Conversion\n\n\nGrade\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nA\n[94, 100]\n\n\nA-\n[90, 94)\n\n\nB+\n[87, 90)\n\n\nB\n[83, 87)\n\n\nB-\n[80, 83)\n\n\nC+\n[77, 80)\n\n\nC\n[73, 77)\n\n\nC-\n[70, 73)\n\n\nD+\n[65, 70)\n\n\nD\n[60, 65)\n\n\nF\n[0, 60)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLab activities\n\nIn-class labs are short activities that you complete during class, often in small groups. They are usually graded as complete or incomplete.\nIn class labs are used as evidence of both attendance and participation.\nYou may have up to two missing or incomplete labs without penalty.\nFor each additional missing or incomplete lab, 2 percentage points will be deducted from your final course percentage.\nMany labs will explicitly involve generative AI. For example,\n\ndebugging AI generated code\nrewriting AI generated explanations for clarity\ncomparing your own solution to an AI solution\n\nYou must follow the generative AI policy described below.\n\n\n\nMidterm mini projects\n\nYou will work in a team on 3 midterm mini projects.\nThis project will focus on a subset of the course content up to that point, for example data wrangling and visualization or a simple predictive model.\nThe mini projects will include\n\nA documented GitHub repository.\nA Quarto report describing your question, data, methods, and findings.\nA short in-class group presentation.\nAn AI usage documents that shows how you used generative AI and how you verified any AI generated content.\n\nMore detailed instructions and rubric will be provided later in the semester.\n\n\n\nFinal project competition\n\nThe final project is a team based competition. Each team will choose one of the following directions or a related idea approved by the instructor.\n\nA data analysis project using statistical models or machine learning algorithms.\nA tutorial style project that introduces an R or Python package not covered in class, including a live demo.\nA project that introduces and demonstrates a (AI) data science tool for visualization, computing, or workflow that was not used in class, including a live demo.\nA project that introduces another programming language for data science, for example Julia, SQL, MATLAB, or SAS, with a live demo.\nA web development project such as a Shiny app or dashboard with a live demo.\n\nYou must complete the final project and be present for the presentation to pass this course.\nEach project must include an AI usage appendix that documents prompts, outputs, and team decisions about what to trust, modify, or reject.\nThe final project presentation is on Thursday, May 1, 2 PM and Monday, May 5, 10:30 AM - 12:30 PM.",

Since there is a column named xyz, the expression df$x will be expanded to df$xyz. This behavior of the $ operator saves a few keystrokes, but it can result in accidentally using a different column than you thought you were using.\n\nWith [ the type of object that is returned differs on the number of columns. If it is one column, it won’t return a data.frame, but instead will return a vector. With more than one column, then it will return a data.frame. This is fine if you know what you are passing in, but suppose you did df[ , vars] where vars was a variable. Then what that code does depends on length(vars) and you’d have to write code to account for those situations or risk bugs.\n\nFor tibbles,\n\nWhen using the matrix subsetting method, a tibble always return a tibble.\n\n\nWhen using $ to grab an element, tibbles never do partial matching.\n\n\n[] always returns another tibble, regardless of list or matrix subsetting method.\n\n\n$ and [[]] return a vector.\n\n\nTibbles never do partial matching and name “x” cannot be recognized.\n\n\nWhat does tibble::enframe() do? Try enframe(c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)). Check ?enframe for more details.\nThe function tibble::enframe() converts named vectors to a data frame with names and values\n\n\niris |&gt; tail(n = 12) |&gt; summary()\n\n  Sepal.Length    Sepal.Width     Petal.Length    Petal.Width   \n Min.   :5.800   Min.   :2.500   Min.   :4.800   Min.   :1.800  \n 1st Qu.:6.150   1st Qu.:3.000   1st Qu.:5.100   1st Qu.:1.900  \n Median :6.600   Median :3.050   Median :5.200   Median :2.200  \n Mean   :6.450   Mean   :3.033   Mean   :5.292   Mean   :2.133  \n 3rd Qu.:6.725   3rd Qu.:3.125   3rd Qu.:5.450   3rd Qu.:2.300  \n Max.   :6.900   Max.   :3.400   Max.   :5.900   Max.   :2.500  \n       Species  \n setosa    : 0  \n versicolor: 0  \n virginica :12"

They will still probably do well on the second quiz, but most of them will not be so lucky the second time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionWhat does the regression coefficient \\(&lt; 1\\) mean in the heights example?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a parent is taller than the average, the regression predicts that his/her child is also taller than the average, but not as much as their parent.\nIf a parent is shorter than the average, the regression predicts that his/her child is also shorter than the average, but again not as much as their parent.\nTherefore, form one generation to the next, people’s heights have “regressed” to the average or mean, in statistics jargon."

We start with learning popular data science tools such as basic R and Python programming, Git and GitHub, and interactive publishing system Quarto. Then we learn data importing, data visualization and data wrangling using both R and Python. The second half of the course focuses on several basic simulation and machine learning methods, including Monte Carlo simulation, linear regression, K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, principal component analysis, and K-means clustering. We learn R tidyverse and tidymodels packages. For Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn libraries are introduced.\nThe course is AI-oriented. Students learn to use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT as assistants for coding, debugging, documenting, and idea generation, while remaining responsible for all analytical decisions, validation, and interpretation.",
