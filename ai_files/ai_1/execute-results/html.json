Import tools make assumptions about missing values, data types, dates, text encoding, and formatting. When assumptions are wrong, the dataset can be changed silently before analysis begins.\n\nYou will use an AI tool as a learning partner to investigate a core data science reality:\n\n\nYou are graded on how you **think, critique, and explain**, not on whether AI gives perfect answers.\n\n\n:::: callout-note\n## To Do\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 1.1em;\"}\n1.  Download the dataset from the [Dataset section](#sec-data) below.\n2.  Write your investigation question (2 to 3 sentences). [Step 1](#sec-step1) in Tasks.\n3.  Run 3 to 5 AI prompts that cover missing values, types, dates, and validation. [Step 2](#sec-step2) in Tasks.\n4.  Import the data and complete checklist items 1 to 4 first. [Step 4](#sec-step4)\n5.  Draft your synthesis, then build slides using the required 5 slide structure. [Step 5](#sec-step5) and [Step 6](#sec-step6)\n:::\n::::\n\n\n## Assigned Roles (3 students)\n\n**[NOTE:] Each student has a designated role for accountability. However, teammates are encouraged to collaborate, support one another, and learn together in order to produce high-quality, cohesive work.**\n\n### Prompt Engineer\n\nResponsibilities\n\n* Create 3 to 5 purposeful AI prompts\n* Save AI responses and build the AI Interaction Log\n* Write annotations for each prompt and response pair\n\n### Data Science Auditor\n\nResponsibilities\n\n* Identify hidden assumptions in AI guidance\n* Design and run post import validation checks\n* Provide evidence for at least two hidden assumptions\n\n### Synthesizer\n\nResponsibilities\n\n* Write the Human Authored Synthesis in clear course language\n* Build slides using the required structure\n* Ensure the final work is consistent and concise\n\n\n## Dataset {#sec-data}\n\nRequired file\n\n* [topic1-data.csv](../documents/topic1-data.csv)\n\nDataset notes\n\n* [README_NYC_Airbnb2019_Topic1.txt](../documents/README_NYC_Airbnb2019_Topic1.txt)\n\n\n## What you will submit\n\n* Group submissions\n  * AI Interaction Log\n  * Human Authored Synthesis\n  * Slides for a 12 to 15 minute presentation\n  \n* Individual submission\n  * Individual Reflection (150 to 200 words)\n\n## Step by step tasks\n\n### Step 1 Define your investigation question (before using AI) {#sec-step1}\n\nWrite 2 to 3 sentences answering:\n\n* What import problem are we investigating\n* Why this problem matters in real data science\n\nYou must focus on hidden assumptions, for example assumptions about missing values, types, dates, or text encoding.\n\n### Step 2 Use AI strategically (3 to 5 prompts) {#sec-step2}\n\n**[Note:] You may run several prompts, but keep 5 most useful and meaningful prompts for reporting.**\n\nYour prompts must be purposeful and iterative.\n\nPrompt requirements\n\n* At least 1 prompt about missing values and missing value representations\n* At least 1 prompt about type guessing and type coercion risks\n* At least 1 prompt about date parsing and mixed date formats\n* At least 1 prompt about validation steps after import\n\n#### Suggested prompt starters (you may adapt)\n\n- *“I am importing a CSV where missing values appear as blank cells, a period, the word unknown, and an em dash. What should I do in R or Python to import correctly and verify it”*\n\n- *“The column `last_review` mixes formats like `2019-06-23`, `06/24/2019`, and `06/20/19`. What is a safe parsing strategy and how do I report failures”*\n\n- *“`price` contains values like `$70`, `70`, and `60 dollars`. What is a safe way to convert to numeric and validate the conversion”*\n\n- *“`minimum_nights` includes values like `2 nights` and `availability_365` includes values like `0/365` or `96 days`. How should I clean these and what checks should I run”*\n\n- *“`room_type` and `neighbourhood_group` have inconsistent capitalization and whitespace. What cleaning steps are reasonable and how do I validate categories after cleaning”*\n\n\n### Step 3 Create the AI Interaction Log {#sec-step3}\n\nFor each prompt, include:\n\n* Prompt goal\n* The AI response excerpt you used\n* Your annotation:\n  * What AI got right\n  * What AI assumed\n  * What was missing, misleading, or incorrect\n\nImportant rule\n\n* You may not paste AI text into your final synthesis verbatim.\n\n### Step 4 Import the dataset and run required validation checks {#sec-step4}\n\nImport the required file, then complete the validation checklist below. Your evidence can be screenshots, printed outputs, or short summaries of what you observed. *A short summary without numbers or outputs does not count as evidence.*\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Required post import validation checklist (expand to view)\n\n<!-- #### Required post import validation checklist (submit evidence for every item) -->\n\n**1. Rows and columns**\n\n   * Confirm the dataset has 600 rows and 16 columns after import.\n\n**2. Missing value representations**\n\n   * Identify at least three different missing value representations present in the file (examples include blank cells, a period, unknown, an em dash).\n   * Choose two columns (recommended: `last_review` and `reviews_per_month`).\n   * Report how many missing values you see in each column, and explain how you defined missingness.\n\n**3. Date column with mixed formats**\n\n   * Check `last_review`.\n   * Show evidence that more than one date format exists in the raw data.\n   * State whether your import tool parsed it as a date or left it as text.\n   * If you parsed it, report how many non missing entries became missing after parsing.\n\n**4. Numeric values stored as text**\n\n   * Choose two columns from this list: `price`, `minimum_nights`, `availability_365`, `reviews_per_month`.\n   * Show the raw formats you observe (for example `$70`, `60 dollars`, `2 nights`, `0/365`, `0.03 per mo`).\n   * State what type your import tool assigned and what conversion would be required.\n\n**5. Currency stored as text**\n\n   * Check `price`.\n   * Show at least three raw examples that are not purely numeric.\n   * State what conversion you would use and one validation check you would run after conversion.\n\n**6. Categorical values with inconsistent formatting**\n\n   * Choose `neighbourhood_group` or `room_type`.\n   * List the unique values you observe before cleaning (include at least 8 examples).\n   * Propose a cleaning rule (for example trim whitespace, standardize case, replace underscores).\n   * Show evidence of how categories change after cleaning (for example fewer unique levels or merged categories).\n\n**7. Text encoding and non ASCII or invisible characters**\n\n   * Find at least one `host_name` that contains a non ASCII character or an invisible character.\n   * Show evidence that the character displays correctly after import.\n   * State what could go wrong if encoding or invisible characters are not handled properly.\n\n**8. Silent coercion risk**\n\n   * Identify one column where a reasonable but incorrect conversion could silently create wrong values or missing values.\n   * Explain the mistake, why it could be hard to notice, and how you would detect it using evidence.\n\n:::\n\n\n### Step 5 Write the Human Authored Synthesis (group) {#sec-step5}\n\nLength target: 400 to 600 words.\n\nYour synthesis must include:\n\n* Your investigation question\n* At least two hidden assumptions with evidence from your validation checks\n* A clear explanation of why the assumptions matter for later analysis\n* A short recommended import and validation routine for this dataset type\n\nYour synthesis must be written in your own words.\n\n### Step 6 Presentation slides (group)\n\nUse this exact slide structure:\n\n* Our question\n* What AI suggested\n* Where AI fell short\n* Our corrected understanding, with evidence\n* One takeaway for future data science work\n\nTime: 12 to 15 minutes.\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/QRCode_ai1.png){width=945}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Individual Reflection (each student)\n\nWrite 150 to 200 words answering:\n\n* What did AI help you learn\n* What did AI miss or oversimplify\n* What did you contribute as a human thinker\n* How will you change your AI use in future data work\n\nYour reflection must match your assigned role.\n\n<!-- ## Submission Examples -->\n\n<!-- * [Excellent AI Interaction Log](documents/ai_prompts.pdf) -->\n<!-- * [Excellent Human Authored Synthesis](documents/ai_audit.pdf) -->\n<!-- * [Excellent Individual Reflections](documents/ai_reflection.pdf) -->\n\n<!-- * [Insufficient AI Interaction Log](documents/ai_prompts_bad.pdf) -->\n<!-- * [Insufficient Human Authored Synthesis](documents/ai_audit_bad.pdf) -->\n<!-- * [Insufficient Individual Reflections](documents/ai_reflection_bad.pdf) -->\n\n\n\n## Participation (non-presenting students)\n\nPlease scan the QR code, or go to <https://forms.office.com/r/eAKU9th9X5> to share what you learned from this activity.\n\n\n",
