This connection comes from Francis Galton, one of the original quantitative social scientists, who fit linear models to under stand the heredity of human height. Predicting children's heights from parent's heights, he noticed that children of tall parents tended to be taller than average but less tall than their parents. From the other direction, children of shorter parents tended to be shorter than average but less short than their parents. Thus, from one generation to the next, people's heights have \"regressed\" to the average or *mean*, in statistics jargon.

Is your actual score higher or lower than your prediction?\n\nYou may expect to do about the same on the second quiz as the first, but I guess *who do worst on the first quiz tend to improve, and who do best tend to decline*.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## Why these improvments and declines occurred?\n\nAre you trying to give an explanation on why such result is occurred? You may think the teams who did the best relaxed on the 2nd quiz, and the teams who did poorly tried harder, and so forth.\n\nHowever, you DO NOT know if your team did well or poorly, comparing to other teams, right?!\n\nIt would be more accurate to say that some do better on this quiz than others, but the very best scores on the first quiz are from people who are both **good and lucky**. They will still probably do well on the second quiz, but most of them will not be so lucky the second time.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## What does the regression coefficient $< 1$ mean in the heights example?\n\nIf a parent is taller than the average, the regression predicts that his/her child is also taller than the average, but not as much as their parent.\n\nIf a parent is shorter than the average, the regression predicts that his/her child is also shorter than the average, but again not as much as their parent.\n\nTherefore, form one generation to the next, people's heights have \"regressed\" to the average or *mean*, in statistics jargon.\n:::\n",
