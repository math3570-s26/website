So we split our data into to sets, training set and testing set, or sometimes called validation set.\n- You can think about your training set as your sandbox for model building. You can do whatever you want, like data wrangling, data transformation, data tidying, and data visualization, all of which help you build an appropriate model.\n- So you Spend most of your time using the training set to develop the model\n- And this is the Majority of the original sample data, which is usually about 75% - 80% of your data. So you basically take a random sample from the data that is about 80% of it. \n- And you don't touch the remaining 20% of the data until you are ready to test your model performance.\n- So the test set is held in reserve to determine efficacy of one or two chosen models\n- Critical to look at it once, otherwise it becomes part of the modeling process\n- and that is the Remainder of the data, usually 20% - 25%\n- So ideally, we hope to use our entire data as training data to train our model, right? And to test the model performance, we just collect another data set as test data to be used for testing performance. But in reality, it is not the usual case. In reality, we only have one single data set, and it is hard to collect another sample data as test data.\n- So under this situation, this type of splitting data becomes a must if we want to have both training and test data. \n\n:::\n\n\n\n## initial_split() in [![rsample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/hex-stickers/master/PNG/rsample.png){width=60}](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-line-numbers=\"false\"}\nbodydata <- read_csv(\"./data/body.csv\")\nbody <- bodydata |> \n    select(GENDER, HEIGHT, WAIST, BMI) |> \n    mutate(GENDER = as.factor(GENDER))\n```\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-line-numbers=\"false\"}\nset.seed(2025)\ndf_split <- \n    rsample::initial_split(\n        data = body, \n        prop = 0.8)\n\ndf_split\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n<Training/Testing/Total>\n<240/60/300>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-line-numbers=\"false\"}\ndf_trn <- rsample::training(df_split)\ndf_tst <- rsample::testing(df_split)\n\ndim(df_trn)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 240   4\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-line-numbers=\"false\"}\ndim(df_tst)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 60  4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n::: notes\nnames(df_split)\n\ndf_split$in_id |> head()\n:::\n\n\n## `body` Data\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_trn\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 240 × 4\n  GENDER HEIGHT WAIST   BMI\n  <fct>   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 1        174. 114.   29.9\n2 0        168.  92.6  25.9\n3 1        184.  86.2  24.7\n4 1        169. 103.   27.4\n5 0        160.  77.7  25  \n6 1        162.  99    30.8\n# ℹ 234 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_tst\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 60 × 4\n  GENDER HEIGHT WAIST   BMI\n  <fct>   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 0        172  120.   33.3\n2 0        154. 120.   45.4\n3 0        158.  89.7  25.8\n4 1        181.  92.5  27.4\n5 1        183.  94.3  21.6\n6 1        162.  88.2  29.1\n# ℹ 54 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n::::\n\n\n\n## What Makes a Good Classifier: Test Accuracy Rate\n\n- The **test accuracy rate** associated with the *test data* $\\{x_j, y_j\\}_{j=1}^J$:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\text{the number of correct predictions, i.e., } y_j = \\hat{y}_j}{J},$$\n\n\n<!-- $$ \\frac{1}{J}\\sum_{j=1}^JI(y_j = \\hat{y}_j),$$ -->\nwhere $\\hat{y}_j$ is the predicted label resulting from applying the classifier to the test response $y_j$ with predictor $x_j$.\n\n\n:::{.question}\nWhat is the value of $J$ in our example?\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n- The *best* estimated **classifier** $\\hat{C}(x)$ trained from the training data for $C(x)$ can be defined as the one producing the *highest test accuracy rate* or *lowest test error rate*.\n\n\n\n## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier\n\nKNN classification uses *majority voting*:\n\n:::{.center}\n[*Look for the most popular class label among its neighbors*.]{.green}\n:::\n\n<!-- - $\\pi_{K}(x) = \\hat{P}(Y = 1 \\mid X = x) = \\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}_x}I(y_i = 1)$ -->\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n<!-- - *Neighbors in __Euclidean distance__ sense.* -->\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/18-knn/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\nWhen predicting at $x = (x_1, x_2) = (8, 6)$,\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat{\\pi}_{3Blue}(x = (8, 6)) &= \\hat{P}(Y = \\text{Blue} \\mid x = (8, 6))\\\\\n&= \\frac{2}{3}\n\\end{align}\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat{\\pi}_{3Orange}(x = (8, 6)) &= \\hat{P}(Y = \\text{Orange} \\mid x = (8, 6))\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{3}\n\\end{align}\n<!-- Thus -->\n<!-- $\\hat{C}_3(x = (8, 6)) = \\text{Blue}$ -->\n\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n::: notes\n\n- Here is a graphical example. Suppose K = 3 and we have two predictors, $x_1$ and $x_2$. We want to do classification of $Y$ when $x_1$ is 8 and $x_2$ is 6.\n- Here how do we define neighbors, we use Euclidean distance to decide who are the point (8, 6)'s neighbors. \n- Showing the idea in the figure, we just use the point (8, 6) as the center of a circle, draw a circle with a larger and larger radius until the circle captures 3 other data points that will be treated as neighbors.\n- Here you can see the green circle captures the points, two are blue and one is orange.\n- So when we do classification at (8, 6), we just compute the proportion of blue neighbors and the proportion of the orange neighbors, and assign the category with the highest proportion or probability to the response variable at the value of predictors (8, 6).\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## K-Nearest Neighbors {visibility=\"hidden\"}\n\nTo predict the category of $y$ at $X = x$, with $y = 0, 1$, `0` being Orange; `1` being Blue\n\n- [Logistic regression]{.green}: $$\\hat{\\pi}(x) = \\hat{P}(Y = 1 \\mid X = x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\hat{\\beta_0}-\\hat{\\beta_1}x}}$$\n\n- [KNN]{.green}: $$\\hat{\\pi}_{K}(x) = \\hat{P}(Y = 1 \\mid X = x) = \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}_K(x)}I(y_i = 1),$$ where $\\mathcal{N}_K(x)$ is the collection of indexes for which the training points $x_i$s are the $K$ neighbors of $x$.\n\n\n::: notes\n\n- Let's see what K-Nearest Neighbors method or KNN is.\n- For the binary logistic regression, \n$p(x) = \\hat{P}(Y = 1 \\mid X = x) = \\frac{e^{\\hat{\\beta_0}+\\hat{\\beta_1}x_1 + \\dots + \\hat{\\beta_p}x_p}}{1+e^{\\hat{\\beta_0}+\\hat{\\beta_1}x_1 + \\dots + \\hat{\\beta_p}x_p}}$. Model parameters include $\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_p$. So linear regression and logistic regression are both parametric approaches. These models have some parameters to be estimated.\n- KNN first identifies the $K$ points that is closest to $x$, or the K nearest neighbors of $x$, then estimates the probability $p_{Km}(x)$ as\n$p_{Km}(x) = \\hat{P}(Y = m \\mid X = x) = \\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}_x}I(y_i = m),$ where $\\mathcal{N}_x$ is the collection of indexes that $x_i$s are the $K$ neighbors of $x$.\n- So the idea is that we first decide how many neighbors of $x$ or K to be used, and then compute the proportion of those neighbors whose y label is category $m$\n- KNN applies the Bayes rule and classifies the test response to the class with the largest probability. That is, $\\hat{C}_K(x) = \\underset{m}{\\mathrm{argmax}} \\ \\ p_{Km}(x)$\n- In the binary case this becomes\n$$\\hat{C}_K(x) = \\begin{cases}\n    0      & p_{Km}(x) < 0.5\\\\\n    1      & p_{Km}(x) > 0.5\n\\end{cases}.$$\nand if the probability for class $0$ and $1$ are equal, simply assign at random.\n- We typically avoid this equal probability thing happened by using odd number of K.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## KNN Decision Boundary\n\n- Blue grid indicates the region in which a test response is assigned to the blue class.\n\n- *We don't know the true boundary (the true classification rule)!*.\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/18-knn/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: notes\n\n- OK. Now for every possible value of $x_1$ and $x_2$, we can classify its corresponding response, right?\n- So we can actually create a dense grid of $x_1$ and $x_2$, and label each point on the grid. \n- And so we can have a whole picture of how the classification result looks like. \n- Blue (Orange) grid indicates the region in which a test observation will be assigned to the blue (orange) class.\n- The curves that separates different classes are called decision boundaries.\n- Again, in reality, we don't know the true boundary, the Bayesian decision boundary.\n\n:::\n\n\n## KNN Training
